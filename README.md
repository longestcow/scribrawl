# scribrawl
online multiplayer game about scribbling and brawling  

the game uses the [$1 Detection algorithm](http://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html) to identfity drawn (scribbled) patterns  
we're using [SteBeeGizmo](https://github.com/SteBeeGizmo/DollarUnity)'s implementation for this game  
the goal is to make a PvP online fighting game where the players make use of synergies between shapes to damage their opponent  
heres what we've got so far:

todo:  
- circles (which become bombs, useful for destroying walls or altering the velocity of arrows)
- brainstorm some other shapes and how they could synergise with other shapes  
- multiplayer demo with a basic gameplay loop
